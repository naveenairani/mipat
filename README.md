# Multi-purpose Image Processing and Analysis Toolkit

This toolkit is designed to provide a wide range of image processing and analysis capabilities, including grayscale-to-color image conversion, object detection, and brain tumor detection. The models are trained on various datasets, providing highly accurate results for different image processing tasks.

## Features

- **Grayscale to Color Conversion**: Converts black and white images to color using deep learning models.
- **Object Detection**: Identifies and classifies objects in images using advanced object detection techniques.
- **Brain Tumor Detection**: Detects the presence of brain tumors in medical images using neural networks.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **TensorFlow**
- **OpenCV**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **NumPy**
- **Pillow**
- **flask**
